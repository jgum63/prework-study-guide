# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of the Prework Study Guide Website is to provide the reader with a guide on everything I learned in the bootcamp. I built the website to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The completed site shows notes on each of those topics plus notes on Git.
